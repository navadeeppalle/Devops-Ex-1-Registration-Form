📋 DevOps Project 1: Student Registration Form – AEC Engineering College

This project is a simple multi-step Student Registration Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed as Experiment 1 in the DevOps Laboratory at ACE Engineering College.

The form captures essential personal and academic details from students and includes a clean, responsive UI. It is a frontend-only demo, with no backend or database integration — ideal for learning basic form handling and validation.

## ✅ How to Use

1. Open [`registrationform.html`](https://github.com/your-username/Devops-Ex-1-Registration-Form/blob/main/registrationform.html) in any modern web browser.  
2. Fill in all required fields on each step.  
3. Use the **Next / Back** buttons to navigate between steps.  
4. On the final step, **Review & Submit** your details.

## 📌 Notes

- This is a **static frontend project** — data is not stored or submitted to a server.
- Designed for **educational purposes**, especially for beginners in web development and DevOps labs.
- Can be used as a **template** for integrating with backend services like Node.js, Flask, or Firebase.
